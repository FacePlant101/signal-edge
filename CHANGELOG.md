# Changelog

signal-edge follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) for 0.x: a breaking change bumps the minor version.

## 0.2.0

First release on npm.

- **Node.js** (22.13 or later): `signal-edge/node` configures TCP (`node:net`) and the WASM modules itself, and adds `nodeSqlite()` (a file path, or an open node:sqlite or better-sqlite3 database; WAL mode, nested transactions) and `createNodeClient()`, which runs maintenance on a timer and has `shutdown()`. `examples/node` is a small CLI (link, status, listen, send).
- CI talks to Signal's servers on every run, without an account: pinned TLS to chat.signal.org, a public-CA host refused, and the provisioning socket (`test/network.test.mjs`, `SIGNAL_NETWORK_TESTS=1`).
- `crypto.ts` no longer names a Workers-only type, so the code typechecks under Node's types too.

## 0.1.0

Extracted from signal-mcp-worker (its main at PR #16) and used by it since 2026-11-09; installed from GitHub, never published to npm.

- `SignalClient`: linking, the receive loop (sealed sender, sender keys, sync transcripts, long texts), sending (1:1 and groups, sealed sender, sender-key group sends, attachments, quotes, reactions, mentions, disappearing-message timers), contacts and groups, retry requests, prekey maintenance, counters that survive restarts.
- `signal-edge/workers`: Cloudflare Workers and Durable Objects (`durableObjectHost`, `durableObjectSql`).
- `signal-edge/selftest`: network-free self-tests.
- Credits in NOTICE and README; THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.txt for the prebuilt WASM.
